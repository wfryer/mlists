# mlists
I created this (with help from Claude.ai) because I want an easy and simple Mastodon list sharing tool. View all or some of your Mastodon lists, create downloadable HTML documents you can share with others which support account following.

Run the current iteration of this script / project on [wfryer.github.io/mlists/](url).

Find me on Mastodon on [mastodon.cloud/@wfryer](url). My other social media channels are on [wesfryer.com/after](url).
