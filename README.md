# mlists
I created this (with help from Claude.ai) because I want an easy and simple Mastodon list sharing tool. View all or some of your Mastodon lists, create downloadable HTML documents you can share with others which support account following.

Run the current iteration of this script / project on [GitHub pages](https://wfryer.github.io/mlists/).

Read more background about this project and my process on [this blog post](https://www.speedofcreativity.org/2025/01/29/sharing-mastodon-lists).

[Find me on Mastodon](https://mastodon.cloud/@wfryer). All my social media channels are on [wesfryer.com/after](https://wesfryer.com/after).
